This work presents the development of an annotation tool that implements a specialized Chat Disentanglement Module, designed to support the creation of annotated datasets for conversation disentanglement research. The module provides a user interface where annotators can identify and mark different conversation threads occurring simultaneously in chatroom data. Chat disentanglement, as described by \textcite{elsner2010disentangling}, is the task of separating multiple concurrent conversations in a single communication channel. Our annotation tool focuses on providing an intuitive and easy user experience to minimize annotation errors, and will be used by the AISIC Lab (Artificial Intelligence and Social Interaction and Complexity) to create annotated datasets of chatroom conversations, which can then be utilized by researchers and annotators to study and develop automated disentanglement solutions.
